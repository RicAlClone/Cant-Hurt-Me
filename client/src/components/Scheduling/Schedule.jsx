            This challenge will help you cut out all wasted time. You will cut your day into time slots and that
            will help you recognize what you can optimize. For the first week, document what you did for every 15 minute
            time block in a day. The second week you want to improve your schedule by cutting out the wasted time.
            Your going to want to follow every scheduled time block completely and move on to the next, once completed.You can schedule breaks that help
            you rest but that doesn't mean do unecessary things like checking emails or social media. Give yourself
            enough time for meals but don't leave them open ended. Even after scheduling week 2 there still might be
            some dead space. Week 3 is your perfect schedule with no time wasted.
